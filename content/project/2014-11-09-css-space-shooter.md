An old-school arcade-style 3D shoot-em-up, rendered entirely with CSS and DOM.

Uses some of the experimental browser APIs which are not yet available in all browsers, so your experience may vary depending on your browser's support and capabilities. Works best in Chrome for me. Internet Explorer doesn't work at all because it uses the Web Audio API.

Featured on Googleâ€™s [Chrome Experiments](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/css-space-shooter) website.
