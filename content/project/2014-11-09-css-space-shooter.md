An old-school arcade-style 3D shoot-em-up, rendered entirely with CSS and DOM.

Uses some of the experimental browser APIs which are not yet available in all browsers, so your experience may vary depending on your browser&#8217;s support and capabilities. Works best in Chrome for me. Internet Explorer doesn&#8217;t work at all because it uses the Web Audio API.
