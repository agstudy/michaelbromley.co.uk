This is an experiment with using the WebRTC getUserMedia API to capture your webcam stream and then use a motion-detection algorithm to create kung-fu movie sound effects to match your motions. The Web Audio API is used for the sound effects.

**Note:** Recent changes to Chrome&#8217;s secutiry policy means this won&#8217;t work on Chrome as it is not currently being served via https. Should work in Firefox, however.
