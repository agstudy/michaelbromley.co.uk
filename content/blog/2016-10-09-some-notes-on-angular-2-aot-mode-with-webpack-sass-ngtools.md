Earlier this week I set out to convert a few of my Angular 2 apps to use Ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation. I&#8217;ve just been to AngularConnect and heard about a project named &#8220;@ngtools/webpack&#8221; ([video here][1]) which supposedly allows you to use the same build tools that the angular-cli project uses, even if you don&#8217;t use the cli (which is the case with my stuff right now).

So I eagerly searched out[@ngtools/webpack on npm][2] and found this:

  <img class="size-full wp-image-552" src="/media/2016/10/ngtools-webpack.png" alt="The @ngtools/webpack npm listing at the moment" width="804" height="708" srcset="/media/2016/10/ngtools-webpack.png 804w, /media/2016/10/ngtools-webpack-300x264.png 300w, /media/2016/10/ngtools-webpack-768x676.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

  </p>
</div>

No readme, no repo, nothing.

So I took a few (dark, frustrating) hours sniffing around and eventually got my apps working. When I mentioned this on Twitter there seemed to be a lot of interest, so I thought I&#8217;d quickly note down the things I found that helped me to implement AoT in my apps.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive tutorial. I fully expect the project authors to document all this at some point, and they will do a much better job than I could. So these are just some notes to point you in the right direction. You&#8217;ll have to roll your sleeves up too, okay?

## What You Need to Know

Here&#8217;s what I found which lead me to figure it all out. _Note: I&#8217;m on Angular 2.0.2 at this time_.

  1. If you&#8217;ve not already, read the [angular.io docs on AoT][3]. This will tell you the basic requirements and concepts.
  2. The @ngtools/webpack project does not have its own repo. It is located [here in the angular-cli repo][4]. The [readme is here][5].
  3. The key to putting it all together was [this example app][6], also hidden deep within the angular-cli repo. Study it carefully. Between the webpack.config.js, package.json & tsconfig.json, it actually contains everything you need to know.
  4. You need to update to **TypeScript 2**.
  5. You need to update to **Webpack 2**. This will probably involve a few changes to your webpack.config.js file, but Webpack 2 is actually very good at instructing you on what is broken. Just read the advice in the command line.
  6. You cannot use `require('..')` to load your templates or styles in AoT mode. You&#8217;ll need to convert to `templateUrl` and `styleUrls`. Don&#8217;t worry though, the @ngtools/webpack plugin will handle the Sass files automatically. For things to keep working when developing in JiT mode, you&#8217;ll need [angular2-template-loader][7].
  7. I had some trouble with the path to the ngfactory code when compiling with ngc: `Can't resolve './../path/to/app/app.module.ngfactory'` This seems related to [this issue][8]. The solution for me was to define theÂ `genDir` in the webpack config rather than the tsconfig.js file.

My ng2-pagination project now includes a demo app which is set up to run in JiT mode for dev, and AoT mode for distribution. Here is the [webpack config][9] file.

## Disclaimer

Even knowing the above, you will run into snags and issues along the way. Just hopefully fewer than I did. Maybe some of the above is incorrect; without official documentation, it can be difficult to know. Seems to work so far though. I expect that in the coming weeks, this article will become obsolete.

Sharpen you debugging and Googling skills and dive in. Good luck!
